Problem Statement of this project is to build a model to categorize the risk of the repayment ability of the borrowers considering various financial metrics other than credit history and evaluate the results. This is a Semi-Supervised Learning problem where customers are classified as high risk, medium risk, and low-risk groups of repaying the loan.

After the initial preprocessing of the data, we have performed Exploratory Data Analysis to analyze the data and handle the challenges described previously. Our approach included the first-ever implementation of fuzzy transformation on the dataset for performing the risk assessment, i.e., to determine the risk category for each rejected loan.

The key goal of the model focused on the general principle of fuzzy sets to statistically analyze linguistic data, classify data based on patterns observed, and to derive organizational information from the viewpoint of any other objective data. There are multiple algorithms in this implementation that involved building custom activation functions and evaluating the accuracy of the model.
